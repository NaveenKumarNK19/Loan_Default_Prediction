# Loan_Default_Prediction
This GitHub repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting loan defaults. The dataset comprises various features such as age, gender, income, credit score, employment status, and loan details like amount, interest rate, and duration.
## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Techniques include handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- **Class Imbalance Handling:** Employed SMOTE technique to handle class imbalance in the target variable (loan status).
- **Model Implementation:** Multiple machine learning models including Decision Tree Regressor, Decision Tree Classifier, and Logistic Regression have been implemented.
- **Model Evaluation:** Performance evaluation includes accuracy scores, classification reports, and confusion matrices.
- **Libraries Used:** Libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, and matplotlib were used for data manipulation, modeling, and visualization.
